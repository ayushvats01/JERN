## PROS ⚡ & CONS ⚠️
> | PROS/CONS |  FEATURES/ISSUE    | DESCRIPTION  | FEATURES/ISSUE | DESCRIPTION  |
> |------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
> | Pros  :zap: |  UI/UX INCLUDES | Easy to use chat interface , Conversation history  |  AI FEATURES |  Recognize user intents and responds |
> | Cons :warning:  |  LOGIN NOT AVALIABLE :exclamation: |  So history of all users is stored at one place which means your chat history with chatbot is visible for everyone, therefore i am requesting you to delete the chat history. This drawback will be resolved in future. |  The bot may take a while to respond :exclamation: |  As it uses a free web server of render , so sometimes bot may takes some time to respond. |
